## Neural Style Transfer Assignment

Welcome to the repository for my Neural Style Transfer assignment. Here, I have implemented the neural style transfer algorithm and have successfully generated novel artistic images using this technique.

The key objectives of this assignment were as follows:
- Implemented the neural style transfer algorithm to combine the style of one image with the content of another.
- Utilized deep learning techniques to extract style and content features from the input images.
- Optimized the generated image to minimize the content and style loss functions simultaneously.
- Experimented with different hyperparameters and settings to achieve visually appealing results.
- By completing this assignment, I have gained practical experience in implementing neural style transfer and understanding the underlying principles. This assignment has allowed me to explore the creative possibilities of combining art styles with different content images.


To explore the code implementation and view the generated artistic images, please refer to the respective files in this repository.


Note: The code and outputs presented here are specific to the Neural Style Transfer assignment and may not be directly applicable for all scenarios. Adaptations and modifications may be required for different style and content combinations or real-world applications.
